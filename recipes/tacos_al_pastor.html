    <h2>About Tacos al Pastor</h2>
    <p>Pastor tacos are a typical dish of Mexican cuisine, originating from Mexico City. They consist of a corn tortilla, to which marinated pork meat is added in a sauce made of sour chilies, such as chipotle chili, and spices such as cumin, garlic, and pepper. The meat is cooked on a spit, a device similar to a rotating grill, and served on the tortilla with onion, cilantro, and pineapple.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for the pork: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 Guajillo Chiles</li>
        <li>5 Pasilla Chiles or Goya Ancho Chiles</li>
        <li>1 chipotle pepper from a can of  Chipotle Chile in Adobo Sauce</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, halved
        </li>
        <li>1 (20 ounce) can Pineapple Chunks</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup White Vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless, skinless pork butt, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Goya Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients for the garnish: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped white onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>2 limes cut into wedges</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped avocado</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add guajillo and pasilla chiles. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until chiles soften, about 10 minutes; transfer to plate. Remove and discard stem and seeds. Meanwhile, coarsely chop one onion half; reserve remaining half. Strain pineapples; reserve juice and fruit separately.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer guajillo, pasilla and chipotle chiles, chopped onion half, reserved pineapple juice, vinegar, garlic and cumin to bowl of food processor. Puree until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer chile mixture to saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring chile mixture to a boil; cook until paste loses raw onion taste, about 2 minutes. Season with Adobo; cool. In large container with lid, or in large ziptop bag, combine pork cubes, cooled chile marinade and reserved pineapple chunks; transfer to refrigerator. Marinate at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Strain pork and pineapples, discarding marinade. Add pork and pineapples to skillet. Cook in batches until dark golden brown on all sides and cooked through, about 15 minutes; transfer to large serving plate.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, finely slice remaining onion half. Transfer sliced onion to bowl with cilantro. Serve pork and pineapple mixture in warm tortillas. Garnish pork tacos with cilantro, onions and limes.
        </li>
    <h2>Tip:</h2>
    <p>For a more authentic taste, use a spit to cook the pork. You can find them at most Mexican markets.</p>
    <p>Warm, soft tortillas, every time! Achieving perfectly warm and pliable tortillas can be tricky business: We find the microwave results in gummy, chewy rounds while the oven dries them out. Our tried-and-true method: steaming. To do, fill a steamer with 1/2 inch water; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. In the meantime, wrap the tortillas in a dish towel. Then, place the bundle in the steamer, cover with a tight-fitting lid and heat until warm, about 10 minutes. (If you don't have a steamer, you can also use a large pot with a colander on top.)</p>
