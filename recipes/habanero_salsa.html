    <h2>Ingredients for the Salsa: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large vine-ripened tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 large or 1 small yellow or white onion cut in half, outer skin removed</li>
        <li>2 large jalapeno peppers stems removed</li>
        <li>2 habanero peppers stems removed
        </li>
        <li>1 garlic clove still in its papery skin from the bulb</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step by Step: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, onion, peppers, and garlic to a heavy-bottom pan. I either use a cast iron skillet or a thick stainless steel pan. Turn heat to high/med-high and wait for the magic to happen. After a minute or two, remove the garlic from the pan and set it aside (you don't want to cook the garlic too long or it will turn sweet). You'll hear sizzling and maybe even popping sounds. After about 5-7 minutes, check the bottom of the veggies, and once charred, turn them over and continue roasting until all sides of the veggies have been nicely roasted.</li>
        <li>Finally, add everything to a blender or food processor with cilantro and salt & pepper. Once room temperature, refrigerate until needed. Enjoy!</li>

    </ul>
